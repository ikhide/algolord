This is a function that refers itself

Stackoverflow - occurs when a function is repeatedly added to the call stack till it overflows
 to prevent this, always have a base case and recursive case. Two return statements.

Recursive algorithms have time complexity of O(2^n) thus really slows down with increasing number of input.
