Hash tables is also called object(javascript) or dictionaries(python)
 

Hash Function 
Its a function that generates a value of fixed length
for each input it gets 

IDEMPOTENT  - a function that returns same output every time for same input.

Hash function is used to create the address location of a value given the key as input.

Maps
e.g const a = new Map()

You can use any data type (function, array) as a key unlike a hash table that only allows string as key

Set
const a = new Set()
just like maps but you can only store keys.
