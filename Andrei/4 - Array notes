* Arrays arrange data sequentially
* Also called List

operations
lookup/access - O(1)
push   - O(1)
insert - O(n)
delete - O(n)

Array methods
push(),pop()   - O(1)
unshift(),shift() - O(n)
splice() - O(n)

There ae two types of Arrays
1. Static: You have to specify he size before hand
2. Dynamic: Memory is automatically allocated to handle data

sometimes when adding an item to an array, javascript will
loop through the array and double the index to store in a new memory location.
This usually leads to an O(n) time complexity. This behavior can also occur with methods like push().

Types of variables 
1. Primitive types: These are created by the programming language e.g integer, string, boolean, null, undefined.

2. Reference types: These are created by the programmer.
Data is stored in boxes in memory and the variable names simply reference that position in memory. e.g array, object.
