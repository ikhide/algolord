- A data structure is a way to organize and manage data
- Time complexity is measure of how fast code runs
- Space complexity is measure of how much memory an algorithm uses

MEMORY

- Optimizing memory usage is important for performance`

STACKS AND QUEUES

- Stacks are LIFO (Last In First Out) e.g, a stack of plates
- Queues are FIFO (First In First Out) e.g, a line of people
- Supports constant time insertion and deletion

GRAPHS

It is a collection of nodes that may or may not be connected to each other

- Every node is a vertex
- Every edge is a connection between two vertices
- A graph is a collection of vertices and edges
- An example is twitter friends. You may be able to follow someone and they may follow you back or not. Some people do not have any followers.
- A cyclic graph is a graph that has three or more vertices connected that forms an infinite loop.
- Acyclic graphs are graphs that do not have cycles.
- Space complexity is O(V + E)
- Time complexity is O(V + E)
- You traverse a graph using DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search).

TREES

- A tree is a type of graph where every node is connected to all of its children, but not to any of its parents.
- A binary tree is a tree where every node has at most two children.
- There are also ternary and n-ary trees.
- Binary search trees are a type of binary tree.(Each left sub tree is less than or equal to the parent node, each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node)
- storing O(n)
- Traversing in O(log(n))
- A branch is any path that starts at the root and ends at a leaf.
- PERFECT BINARY TREE: A binary tree where every node has tw child and every branch has same depth.
- COMPLETE BINARY TREE: A binary tree where every node has two children but the leftest branch has the highest depth.
- INCOMPLETE BINARY TREE: A binary tree where every node has two children but the leftest branch does not have the highest depth.
- BALANCED BINARY TREE: A binary tree where the difference in the depth of the two subtrees of every node is at most one.
- FULL BINARY TREE: A binary tree where every node has either two or no children.

STRINGS

- Inserting into a string is O(n)
- adding two strings together is O(n+m)
